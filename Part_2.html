    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Faisal Singca</strong>, a passionate student at the <em>University of Mindanao</em> with a strong interest in Full Stack Web Development. I began my college journey in the 2024–2025 academic year, and since then, I've been dedicated to sharpening my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

      <p>I live by the motto: <em>"Take the risk or lose the chance."</em> This mindset fuels my drive to embrace challenges, learn continuously, and grow as a developer. Outside of coding, I find inspiration in anime and video games—they spark my creativity and keep me motivated.</p>

      <p>I'm excited about the future and eager to contribute to the tech world with innovative ideas and meaningful projects. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
